{"name":"Beyond a Smart Video Surveillance approach for Road Traffic Monitoring","tagline":"Team 2 - M4: Video Analysis","body":"### Abstract\r\n\r\nThe presented project aims to solve the problem of road traffic monitoring. The main goal is concerned about counting the amount of vehicles on a road and estimate their speed using visual cues. Our solution shows an optimized approach through the typical adaptive Gaussian modelling in order to subtract the background. Then, some well-known morphological filters and shadow removal techniques are applied to refine the proposed methodology. Moreover, stabilization methods have been studied to eliminate jitter effect caused by wind. Finally, a Kalman filter is used to track each vehicle appearing in the sequence with a homography matrix that obtains the correct perspective for computing the final speed.\r\n\r\nInterested researchers can find more information and details about the aforementioned approach by clicking [this link](https://github.com/mcv-m4-video/Team2/blob/master/smart-video-surveillance.pdf).\r\n\r\n### Supplementary material\r\n\r\nThis section includes the slides for each week deliverable, explaining in an accurate way the methodology that has been followed.\r\n\r\n* **Week 1**: [Introduction.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cmQc1l_XB6FGxfXLNL5UzFXNSeAPGr-67ZgEO5hpteE/edit)\r\n\r\n* **Week 2**: [Background extraction.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tk_wcdDxDdIM7VQJwty0orljlDZQlplnpiow4KdmdwA/edit)\r\n\r\n* **Week 3**: [Morphological filtering and shadow removal.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1djWxjvnbKg7_Dj_TanlEJJanVY6dysGuuN2K2CMsZJk/edit#slide=id.gfc209c64e_0_11)\r\n\r\n* **Week 4**: [Camera stabilization.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15c8PE1LS4s-kaZIaRwNi4WHyrjDJKGnGueYU2C8LgeE/edit#slide=id.gfdc16ce5f_1_73)\r\n\r\n* **Week 5**: [Tracking and speed estimation.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15c8PE1LS4s-kaZIaRwNi4WHyrjDJKGnGueYU2C8LgeE/edit#slide=id.gfdc16ce5f_1_73)\r\n\r\nIn addition, we have made public and available through GitHub the whole [Matlab code](https://github.com/mcv-m4-video/Team2) regarding our implementation.
