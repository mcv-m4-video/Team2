{"name":"Video Surveillance for Road Traffic Monitoring","tagline":"Team 2 - M4: Video Analysis","body":"### Beyond a smart video surveillance approach for road traffic monitoring\r\n\r\nThis paper tries to solve the problem of road traffic monitoring. The main goal is to count the amount of vehicles on a road and estimate their speed using visual cues. Our solution presents an optimized approach of the typical adaptive Gaussian modelling, in order to subtract the background. Then, morphological filters and shadow removal are applied to refine the solution. Stabilization methods have been studied to remove jitter effect caused by the wind. Finally, a Kalman filter is used to track each vehicle appearing in the sequence, and a homography matrix is applied in the sequences to obtain the correct perspective for computing the speed.\r\n\r\n### Supplementary material\r\n\r\nWeek 1 [Introduction](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1cmQc1l_XB6FGxfXLNL5UzFXNSeAPGr-67ZgEO5hpteE/edit)\r\n\r\nWeek 2 [Background extraction](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1tk_wcdDxDdIM7VQJwty0orljlDZQlplnpiow4KdmdwA/edit)\r\n\r\nWeek 3 [Morphological filtering and shadow removal](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1djWxjvnbKg7_Dj_TanlEJJanVY6dysGuuN2K2CMsZJk/edit#slide=id.gfc209c64e_0_11)\r\n\r\nWeek 4 [Camera stabilization](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15c8PE1LS4s-kaZIaRwNi4WHyrjDJKGnGueYU2C8LgeE/edit#slide=id.gfdc16ce5f_1_73)\r\n\r\nWeek 5 [Tracking and speed estimation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1o7hRjNxVW-1mSV4XIpTouypcbiirAYto3jRtl-TODqE/edit)\r\n\r\n\r\n[Code](https://github.com/mcv-m4-video/Team2)\r\n\r\n### Project Team : Authors\r\n\r\nMonica Alfaro\r\n\r\nAndrea Calafell\r\n\r\nMartin Matilla\r\n\r\nJordina Torrents","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
